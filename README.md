Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wanted a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It. They needed software that works on multiple platforms, supports multiplayer functionality, and uses unique identifiers for games, teams, and players. It also needed to allow only one active game instance, while ensuring scalability and secure data handling.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I effectively used object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and the singleton pattern, which contributed to a clear, well-structured design. The UML diagram provided an easy-to-understand visual of system relationships.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document acted as a clear roadmap, helping to outline client requirements, establish design constraints, and ensure that the software met functionality, scalability, and memory needs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would clarify the user interface requirements by adding more details about how the game should look and function, making it easier for developers to create a consistent design.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I aligned the design with the client’s specifications, such as using the singleton pattern to allow only one game instance. Addressing user needs is crucial for creating software that is functional, user-friendly, and successful.

 How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
 
I started by analyzing the requirements, creating UML diagrams, and developing a structured plan. In the future, I would involve more user feedback and use agile methods for iterative development and quicker adjustments.
