Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a client aiming to develop a web-based version of their existing game, Draw It or Lose It. They wanted software that could run across multiple platforms, supporting multiplayer functionality with unique identifiers for games, teams, and players. The software also needed to ensure that only one game instance could run at any given time, while maintaining scalability and secure data management.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
By applying object-oriented principles effectively, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and the singleton pattern, which helped in creating a well-structured design. The UML diagram was also a strong point, as it provided a clear visual representation of the system’s architecture, making it easy to understand the relationships and dependencies between entities.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document provided a comprehensive roadmap that guided the coding process. It helped to clarify the client’s requirements, establish design constraints, and align the code with the specified features. This structured approach ensured that the software met requirements for functionality, scalability, and memory management.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the user interface (UI) requirements to make them clearer and easier to understand. I’d include more detailed descriptions of how the game should look and feel, making sure that the design is straightforward for developers to follow and implement consistently across platforms.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user’s needs were interpreted by closely aligning the design with the client’s specifications. For instance, implementing the singleton pattern addressed the requirement of maintaining a single game instance, while scalable infrastructure supported multiple teams and players. Considering the user’s needs is critical, as it ensures that the software remains functional, user-centric, and successful upon release, ultimately leading to better user satisfaction.

 How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The software design process began by analyzing the client’s requirements and translating them into clear design constraints, UML diagrams, and a structured development plan. In the future, I would incorporate more user feedback sessions during the design phase to ensure that the design meets evolving user expectations. Additionally, using agile methodologies, such as iterative development and continuous feedback, would allow for more flexibility and rapid adjustments throughout the development process.
